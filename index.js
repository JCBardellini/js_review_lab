/* A. Q + A
1 - = (we can assign a variable with an assignment operator ex: let variableName = "something")
2 - = (we can change the value of the variable with the assignment operator ex: variableName = "newValue")
3 - = (we use the assignment operator to assign the existing variable to new variable ex: let newVariable = oldVariable)
4 - declare - a variable with no value, assign - assigning a value to the declare variable , define - it is the value of the variable or function or object
5 - pseudocoding is writing out the steps to solve the problem logically without writing the code
6 - We should spend around 90% thinking about solving the problem before writing code
